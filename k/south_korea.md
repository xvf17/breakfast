# South Korea
26 February, 2023

South Korean breakfast: street toast. This was very enjoyable. Very
easy to make, and pairs very well with coffee. I'd say it's more or
less a standard American breakfast sandwich, except there were lots of
vegetables mixed in with the egg. My understanding is that this is a
reasonably common street food in South Korea.
