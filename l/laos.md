Lao breakfast: khao jee. Delicious sausage sandwich. I doubt if the
bollillo roll is traditional, but the recipe author recommended it so
I went along. I preordered the sausages on line, but discovered after
they arrived that it was just a spice mix, so I had to mix and stuff
the sausages myself. If you ever try this recipe, I highly recommend
you make patties instead of stuffing into casings.

Cole slaw was home made as well, but no recipe link; it was pretty generic.
