# Suriname
18 August, 2024

Surinamese breakfast: teloh. Basically, mashed plaintains, shallow
fried for a crispy exterior.  Very simple to prepare, goes quickly,
and quite a satisfying result.

The peanut sauce is stolen from another Surinamese recipe, with some
substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients. I used ginger in place of
the galangal, and a soy sauce honey mixture in place of the kecap mania.
