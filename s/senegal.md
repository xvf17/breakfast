# Senegal

Senegali breakfast: ndambe. The sandwiches were delicious. The recipe
says it serves 4, but I think I could have easily made 6 sandwiches
with half the recipe. I'm not a fan of black eyed peas, so the
leftover stew is pretty unappealing. (You can't taste them inside the
sandwiches.) Fortunately, my wife will eat anything.

The baguettes were from Peter Reinhart's <i>The Bakers Apprentice</i>.
