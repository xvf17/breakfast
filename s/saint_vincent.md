# Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
7 April, 2024

Saint Vincentian breakfast: accra. Salt cod fritters. Yum! I made half
the recipe, turned out to be four servings, but who's complaining?

I am [forbidden](../a/antigua_and_barbuda.html) from making Carribian
style salt cod any more, so I tried a Spanish style for this one. It
takes 90 minutes instead of a week, and isn't nearly as stinky, but
the flavor is more muted, so you couldn't really taste it in the final
product.
