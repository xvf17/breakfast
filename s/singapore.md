Singaporean breakfast: soft-cooked eggs with kaya jam and toast. This
was super easy. I used the immersion circulator for the eggs, because
there was less guesswork. The result was absolutely delicious.

I didn't do the kaya jam properly, because I couldn't find coconut
cream (so used milk) and I didn't have the right sugar. Nonetheless,
it came out very tasty. I have to make it again with the proper
ingredients.

The bread is _Maryetta's Oatmeal Bread_ from James Beard's _Beard on Bread_.
