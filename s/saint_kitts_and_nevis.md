# Saint Kitts and Nevis
24 March, 2024

Kittitian breakfast: plantain porridge. This tasted OK, but it didn't
have much staying power. I was hungry again after two hours. It came
out more like a soup than a porridge, which was a little strange to
me. I think I would like it better if it was a little chewier.
