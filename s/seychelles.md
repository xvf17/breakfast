Seychellois breakfast: coconut chicken curry. This was delicious. The
recipe says it makes 8 servings, but it's really more like 6, but it
was wonderful. Not nearly as jarring to my sensibilities as I had
expected, having this for breakfast. The spice level here was rather
milder than many of the curries I've had, which probably helped it be
a good breakfast food.

Not much to say really about the dish. It's more or less your standard
coconut curry. Pretty easy to make, tastes fine.
