# A personal project to make breakfast from every country in the world

I started this project on the 25th of April, 2021. My pledge to myself
was that I would make breakfast for my wife and myself every Sunday,
once each from every country in the UN offical list of world
countries. I decided to do it in alphabetical order, so that I
wouldn't get fatigued by any region. It's been a delightful journey,
and I hope you enjoy reading about it.

Here is a complete list of the countries. If there isn't a link for
it, it's because I haven't gotten there yet.
