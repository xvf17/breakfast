# Nigeria
19 November, 2023

Nigerian breakfast: stir fried instant ramen with jammy egg. The
recipe just said "boiled egg", but I interpreted that as jammy egg
because that's the way I like them. Also, due to an oversight when
shopping this week, I inadvertently made the vegetarian version of
this. No worries, though; it was quite tasty.

The flavors were excellent, but my wife found it a touch spicy. Would
definitely eat this again.
