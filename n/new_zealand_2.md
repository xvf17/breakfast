# New Zealand
22 December, 2023

New Zealand breakfast: Weet-Bix. A few New Zealanders reached out to
me about my first effort to honor their country. They had never heard
of the dish, and suggested this alternative.

This is a breakfast cereal, not to be confused with Weetabix. Often
served with fruit. I have to say that for me, the texture was a little
off-putting, and it gets soggy <i>really</i> quickly. I prefer the
American Shredded Wheat, but it did keep us full all morning.
