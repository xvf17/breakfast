# Nepal
15 October, 2023

Nepali breakfast: dahi-chiura. Aside from making the flattened rice,
this was about as complicated as pouring a bowl of breakfast
cereal. Taste was surprisingly good for such a simple concept. Alas,
both my wife and I were hungry before lunch time; maybe supplement
with some other items.

Sorry for the crappy photo; I couldn't get my camera to focus.
