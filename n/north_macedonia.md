# North Macedonia
26 November, 2023

Macedonian breakfast: zelnik. Basically cabbage pie.  We liked this
more than we expected. It has a very high fat content, and I think
that made it more interesting than it would otherwise have been.  No
plans to move to North Macedonia, though.

I think I misunderstood the instructions in the recipe, so I didn't
get the pastry layers I was supposed to.
