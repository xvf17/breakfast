New Zealand breakfast: canned spaghetti on toast. This was a strange
one for me. I didn't like it as much as I expected to, but I think it
would be a great hangover breakfast. It's been a long time since I had
canned spaghetti, and I think my tastes have changed a lot since those
days.  On the plus side, this was one of the easiest breakfasts I've
ever made.

The "recipe" is way off; 400 grams of spaghetti is definitely enough
for two servings.

Bread was from _Beard on Bread_, by James Beard.
