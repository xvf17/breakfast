Norwegian breakfast: Laks og Egger&oslash;re. Toast, smoked salmon,
fried eggs. One of the easist breakfasts I've made on this project,
and oh so tasty.

The bread is fanstastic. I think I left my dough a little
under-hydrated, so I didn't get the rise or oven spring I was hoping
for, but it was delicious.
