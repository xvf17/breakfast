# Nicaragua
5 November, 2023

Nicaraguan breakfast: desayuno typ&iacute;co (typical breakfast). In
my case, this consisted of gallo pinto (rice and beans), pico de
gallo, fried eggs, fried plantains, fried cheeese, and corn
tortillas.  Killer breakfast, but I don't see how this could really be
typical, with so many components. It was very good, including probably
the best corn tortillas I've ever made.
