# Wales

Welsh breakfast: rarebit. This. Was. Awesome. So easy to make, and
just fabulous. Not a figure friendly dish, so best reserved for
special occasions, but man was it tasty. And it was plenty of food, no
getting hungry before lunchtime.  The cheese sauce had a rich earthy
umami thing going on that I realy dug.

The bread was from Peter Reinhart's <i>The Bakers Apprentice</i>.
