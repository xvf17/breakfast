# Sausage Gravy

For two servings:<br>

2 Tbl olive oil<br>
1 Tbl chopped garlic<br>
1/4 cup chopped yellow onion<br>
1/3 pound breakfast sausage<br>
2 Tbl butter
2 Tbl flour<br>
1 cup whole milk (approximately)<br>
black pepper<br>

<p>
Heat the oil over medium heat, then add onions and garlic and sweat
for 2-3 minutes, until onion is translucent.  Add the sausage, and
cook through.

<p>
Add the butter and stir until it melts.  Add the flour, and stir in to
make a paste. When the flour has disappeared, add a splash of milk and
mix it in with a spatula.  Continue to add splashes of milk until you
get the consistency you want. It should end up more or less like
pancake batter. Season to taste with black pepper.

<p>
Note that it will thicken as it sits on the stove, so keep the
milk handy to re-thin as necessary.
