# Yemen
16 February, 2025

Yemeni breakfast: jachnun. This was a little strange on my palate. The
eggs tasted kind of like hard boiled, but there was a strange
aftertaste, and the yolks were a little green at the edge, which is
not a good sign.

The pastry was very dry; perhaps I didn't use enough ghee when making
them. It was OK with the tomato dip, but not good enough for me to
make this again.
