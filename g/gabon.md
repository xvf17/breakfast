# Gabon
7 August, 2022


Gabonese breakfast: coupe&#769;-coupe&#769; steak sandwich. I was not
disappointed to discover this is what I had to make for
Gabon. Delicious.

[recipe](https://www.oneworldwhisk.com/post/gabon-coup%C3%A9-coup%C3%A9-steak-sandwich-with-spicy-peanut-sauce-and-cucumber-salad))<br>
The baguette is from Maggie Glezer's _Artisan Baking_.
