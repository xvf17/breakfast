Filipino breakfast: Tortang Ginling with garlic fried rice and banana
ketchup. This was an excellent breakfast. I enjoyed every bite, and
would happily eat this again. The pancakes (tortang), especially, were
extremely enjoyable.

You could make the banana ketchup to have with other things; it seems
quite versatile. It would go well, I think, on anything that you use
tomato ketchup for. And it's super easy!
