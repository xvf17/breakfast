# Portugal
18 February, 2024

Portugese breakfast: tosta mista. Ham, cheese, egg on toasted
bread. Really tasty, and the bread toasted up perfectly. We both
enjoyed this very much.

This was very remaniscent of the
[Brazil entry](../b/brazil.html). They speak Portugese in
Brazil. Hmm. I seem to be stuck in a rut. (They also speak Portugese
in [Mozambique](../m/mozambique.html).)
