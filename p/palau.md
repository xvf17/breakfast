# Palau
24 December, 2023

Palauan breakfast: grilled fish with rice. The recipe calls for
snapper, but it says any atlantic fish is fine, so I went with
salmon. Very simple to make, and very tasty. I still haven't been able
to source banana leaves, so that part was omitted. Overall, a good
choice for breakfast.
