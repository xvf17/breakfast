# Palestine
31 December, 2023

Palestinian breakfast: fatayer. Basically a no-sauce pizza, with
middle-eastern spices. (I didn't do the cheese version because it was
going to be difficult to scale down to two servings.) These were
fantastic. I think two apiece would have been plenty.

Would definitely make this again.
