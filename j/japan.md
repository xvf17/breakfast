Japanese breakfast: Traditional Japanese breakfast.  Tamagoyaki,
sesame broccoli, salted salmon, steamed rice, pickled cucumbers, miso
soup, and tea. The salmon had to be started two days ahead, and the
pickles one day ahead. I also chose to make the dashi (a component of
the soup) a day in advance. As a result, this whole thing came
together in about 40 minutes. It was really very good. The tamagoyaki
(omelete) was very small, using only one egg for two people. My wife
said she could easily have eaten two whole ones by herself; they were
quite delicious.

This entire breakfast was extraordinary. My understanding is that it's
a special occasion kind of thing for the Japanese people who eat it,
but it was very fun to explore.

On a more personal note: There is a band called Japanese Breakfast
that I heard interviewed on NPR. I was so intrigued by the name that I
thought about it a lot, and it's what led me to start this project to
begin with. So it's pretty satisfying to hit this milestone.
