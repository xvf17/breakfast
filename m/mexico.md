# Mexico
30 July, 2023

Mexican breakfast: machaca, with refried beans, salsa fresca, flour
tortillas. This took a long time to make, but the results were
amazing. A little frantic in the kitchen when everything got done at
the same time, trying to cook the tortillas while shredding the
beef. Why do I do this to myself?
