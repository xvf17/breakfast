Marshallese breakfast: Donat. Pretty much just doughnuts. Very tasty,
but the recipe was a bit of a challenge to follow. I think there's too
much water in it, because I got a batter instead of a dough, and it
was impossible to roll out without adding more flour.

Also, they say it's three per serving, but my wife and I could only
eat three between us.
