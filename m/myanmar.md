Myanma breakfast: burmese egg curry. This was very tasty. I had a
little trouble scaling it down, and ended up with way too much oil,
but that was pretty easy to eat around. The recipe says to boil the
eggs for 6 minutes, but that seemed a little under done for what they
were describing.  Would definitely eat this again.
