# Malaysia
11 June, 2023

Malaysian breakfast: Nasi Lemak, sambal, fried peanuts, chicken
rendang. This was a huge breakfast, we were both quite full when we
left the table. The sambal was a little spicy for my wife, but I loved
it. I had to substitue pandang extract for the pandang leaves, which
is why my rice is green.
