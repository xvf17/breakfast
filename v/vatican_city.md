# Vatican City
26 January, 2025

Vaticanian breakfast: maritozzi. Brioche buns filled with sweetened
whipped cream. These were just OK, and boy were they a lot of work. I
had to start Friday night to avoid getting up at 4am today. In the
end, the buns were a little dry, and there wasn't enough whipped cream
to offset that. I definitely won't make these again; I might try one
if I see it in a bakery somewhere.
