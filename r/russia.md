# Russia
10 March, 2024

Russian breakfast: syrniki. These were fabulous. Would definitely make
them again. They are mostly made of farmer's cheese, with a little egg
and flour mixed in to make them hold together.  Looked small on the
plate, but we each got 1/4 pound of cheese, which was plenty.

I think berries are more traditional as the topping, but I had the
tangerine marmalade already, and it really worked well.
