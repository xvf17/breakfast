# Romania
3 March, 2024

Romanian breakfast: eggs, zacusca spread, bread, mamaliga, and
cheese. Wasn't able to source the proper Romanian cheese, but my
reading suggested that feta was a near miss. Zacusca and bread were
made the previous day, so this all went pretty smoothly. The mamaliga
recipe's timings seemed way off; it was done far earlier than they
suggested.

Overall, this was a very satisfying breakfast. I like the many
components aspect, and the zacusca was amaze-balls delicious. The feta
paired very well with the mamaliga and the zacusca. Super entry to the
world of breakfasts.
