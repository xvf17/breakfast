# Oman
10 December, 2023

Omani breakfast: regag with honey. This was a real challenge for me. I
think I got the flavors right, but the batter was perhaps too thick,
and I didn't have the right cooking surface, so the whole thing was a
huge sticky mess when I was cooking it. I think it tasted pretty good,
and I think I could get better with practice. Certainly the person in
the video I watched was having a much calmer go of it than I did.

The recipe is a little hard to parse. Best as I could make out,
everything before the cassette box (yes, really) is the batter, and
the rest is fillings/toppings.
