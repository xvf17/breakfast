# Trinidad and Tobago
27 October, 2024

Trini breakfast: doubles. These were delicious. Basically, a chick pea curry over a fried flat bread. It's a common street food in Trinidad and Tobago.

I have no idea why the sauce came out so red. I tend to have a heavy
hand with spices, so it's possible I overdid something, but this was a
real surprise.
