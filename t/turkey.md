# Turkey
10 November, 2024

Turkish breakfast: menemen. This is very similar to
[shakshuka](../i/israel.md), but with a bit less emphasis on tomato.
Stewed vegetables, served optionally with sliced baguettes.  We both
liked this a lot, and it is very easy to make. Almost certainly up for
a repeat at some point.

The baguette is from Maggie Glazer's _Artisan Bread_.
